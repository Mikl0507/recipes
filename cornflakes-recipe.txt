Cornflakes Serves one

Preparation

1. Gather you equipment

You will need:
	1 bowl
	1 spoon

2. Gather your ingredients

You will need:
	Cornflakes
	Milk (optional)
		Milk can be cow, goat, sheep, soya, skimmed, semi-skimmed, full-fat, bottled, cartoned, from a jug in the fridge or any combination of the above

Method:
	1. open cornflakes
		It is always nice to have a new box (the cornflakes are crisp and fresh) but I understand this is not always possible. For this recipe old, stale cornflakes work just as well
	2. shake cornflakes into bowl. You may also pour them, but shaking is more energetic and  preferable if only for that reason. 
	3. open milk
		This stage is optional. If you like milk and have the patience, transfer as much milk as you can handle to the bowl. If you rush you will cause the cornflakes to erupt from the bowl and scatter. Take your time.
		If you are very hungry, don't like milk of any kind or can't be bothered you can skip this step and go straight to step 4
	4. eat cornflakes.
